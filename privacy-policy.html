        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy outlines how Yt To Mp3 treats personal information related to the use of the Yt To Mp3 website and the services offered on and through it (the “Service”), including information provided when using it.</p>

        <p>When you access the Service, use the search function, convert files, or download files, we may record your IP address, country of origin, and other non-personal information about your computer or device (such as web requests, browser type, browser language, referring URL, operating system and date and time of requests) for log file information, aggregated traffic information, and in the event that there is any misappropriation of information and/or content.</p>
        <p>We may record information about your usage of the Service, such as your search terms, the content you access and download, and other statistics. Any content that you upload, access or transmit through the Service may be collected by us. We may keep a record of any correspondence between you and us.</p>
        <p>We may use cookies, web beacons, and other information to store information so that you will not have to re-enter it on future visits, provide personalized content and information, monitor the effectiveness of the Service, and monitor aggregate metrics such as the number of visitors and page views (including for use in monitoring visitors from affiliates). They may also be used to provide targeted advertising based on your country of origin and other personal information.</p>
        <p>We may aggregate your personal information with personal information of other members and users and disclose such information to advertisers and other third parties for marketing and promotional purposes. We may use your information to run promotions, contests, surveys, and other features and events.</p>
        <p>We may be required to release certain data to comply with legal obligations or in order to enforce our Terms of Use and other agreements. We may also release certain data to protect the rights, property or safety of us, our users and others. This includes providing information to other companies or organizations like the police or governmental authorities for the purposes of protection against or prosecution of any illegal activity, whether or not it is identified in the Terms of Use.</p>
        <p>If you upload, access or transmit any illegal or unauthorized material to or through the Service, or you are suspected of doing such, we may forward all available information to relevant authorities, including respective copyright owners, without any notice to you.</p>
        <p>While we use commercially reasonable physical, managerial and technical safeguards to secure your information, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure and we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information or content you transmit to us.
